    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Thavamuneeswar Temple refers to the Arulmigu Thavamuneeswarar Temple in Avadi, Chennai, dedicated to Lord Muneeswarar, a powerful guardian deity (often called "Bodyguard Muneeswarar") known for protection against accidents, with roots tracing back to 1919 when laborers brought the idol to Chennai and it gained fame for miraculous interventions, leading to temple construction, especially popular for its strong spiritual influence and traditional worship.  </p>
